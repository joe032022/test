GitHub, Inc., is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.[4] Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.[5]

It is commonly used to host open source software development projects.[6] As of June 2022, GitHub reported having over 83 million developers[7] and more than 200 million repositories,[8] including at least 28 million public repositories.[9] It is the largest source code host as of November 2021. 

From 2012, Microsoft became a significant user of GitHub, using it to host open-source projects and development tools such as .NET Core, Chakra Core, MSBuild, PowerShell, PowerToys, Visual Studio Code, Windows Calculator, Windows Terminal and the bulk of its product documentation (now to be found on Microsoft Docs).[37][38]

On June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion. The deal closed on October 26, 2018.[39] GitHub continued to operate independently as a community, platform and business.[40] Under Microsoft, the service was led by Xamarin's Nat Friedman, reporting to Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft Cloud and AI. GitHub's CEO, Chris Wanstrath, was retained as a "technical fellow," also reporting to Guthrie. Nat Friedman resigned November 3, 2021; replaced by Thomas Domke. [41]

There have been concerns from developers Kyle Simpson, JavaScript trainer and author, and Rafael Laguna, CEO at Open-Xchange over Microsoft's purchase, citing uneasiness over Microsoft's handling of previous acquisitions, such as Nokia's mobile business and Skype.[42][43]

This acquisition was in line with Microsoft's business strategy under CEO Satya Nadella, which has seen a larger focus on cloud computing services, alongside the development of and contributions to open-source software.[5][38][44] Harvard Business Review argued that Microsoft was intending to acquire GitHub to get access to its user base, so it can be used as a loss leader to encourage the use of its other development products and services.[45]

Concerns over the sale bolstered interest in competitors: Bitbucket (owned by Atlassian), GitLab and SourceForge (owned by BIZX, LLC) reported that they had seen spikes in new users intending to migrate projects from GitHub to their respective services.[46][47][48][49][50]

In September 2019, GitHub acquired Semmle, a code analysis tool.[51] In February 2020, GitHub launched in India under the name GitHub India Private Limited.[52] In March 2020, GitHub announced that they were acquiring npm, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an undisclosed sum of money.[53] The deal was closed on 15 April 2020.[54]

In early July 2020, the GitHub Archive Program was established, to archive its open-source code in perpetuity
